# 🚀 My Programming Journey

Welcome to my personal learning repository!  
This is where I document my progress, practice exercises, and small projects while learning different programming languages and concepts.

---

## 🧠 About
I’m currently studying **software engineering** and exploring languages like **C++**, **C#**, **Python**, and more.  
This repository serves as my learning archive — from basic syntax and loops to object-oriented programming and larger projects.

---

## 📂 Structure
Each folder focuses on a specific language or topic:

learning/
│
├── C++/
│   ├── basics/
│   ├── loops/
│   ├── arrays/
│   └── projects/
│
├── C#/
│   ├── console-apps/
│   └── winforms/
│
├── Python/
│   └── small-scripts/
│
└── README.md

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **C++** – CLion, Xcode, or Visual Studio Code  
- **C#** – Visual Studio or JetBrains Rider  
- **Python** – VS Code or PyCharm  
- **Git & GitHub** – version control and portfolio tracking

---

## 🌱 Current Goals
- Strengthen understanding of loops, functions, and classes  
- Build small console projects  
- Practice clean code and version control with Git  
- Explore beginner-level algorithms and data structures
